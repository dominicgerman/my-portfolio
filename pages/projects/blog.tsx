            This is a very simple blog app that uses Redux as a state management
            solution. The frontend was bootstrapped with create-react-app and
            the backend is an Express server with a MongoDB database. Logged in
            users can view a list of blogs, create new blog posts, delete posts,
            view a list of users and like other posts.

            This project was part of the problem sets for the Full Stack Open
            online web development course. Refactoring from useState to Redux
            was part of the final problem set. I utilized Material UI for some
            rudimentary styling as well as React Router for navigation.

            I'll be adding a comments section and more styling in the near
            future. I went with Material UI in these exercises because it was
            new to me and because I wanted experience working with a library of
            premade UI components. You can log in with username 'kodathedog' and
