            I converted the state management setup from useState to Redux, I
            incorporated Material UI for some rudimentary styling, and I used
            React Router for navigation. I also created separate views for
            individual blog posts and a view for listing all users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of these tasks were tedious but they were also incredibly
            educational. I'll be adding a comments section and more styling in
            the near future. I went with Material UI in these exercises because
            it was new to me and because I wanted experience working with a
            library of premade UI components.
