            This is my portfolio site. I built it with NextJS and Vercel. The

            online web development course. My wife was kind enough to design the
            site in Figma so that I could practice creating a pixel-perfect
            version.

            The first version of this site was a sinlge HTML page that resembled
            the current home page. I had just learned Flexbox and Grid layouts
            in CSS and needed to put those skills to the test. After I became
            comfortable with React, I decided to rebuild my portfolio. I used it
            as an opportunity to dive into NextJS with CSS modules. I'm glad I
            did. NextJS is an outstanding framework from my point of view.

            I also used Typescript on this project. I am new to Typescript but
            I'm already a huge fan. It's a very powerful tool and I'm looking
            forward to using it more.
