# Portfolio Site

### Overview

This is my personal portfolio for displaying my work as a developer. 

- [Live site](https://dominicgerman.com)

### Built with

- TypeScript
- Next.js 13 (React)
- CSS
- Pocketbase
- Docker
- Figma

### Process

This site has gone through numerous iterations. It was originally just HTML and CSS. As I learned more about JS frameworks and databases, I began using this site as a playground for testing new technologies. The current version is built with Next.js 13 and Turbopack which includes many features that are still in beta. I used PocketBase to store my data -- it's an open source backend SaaS that uses SQLite under the hood. It requires self-hosting so I deployed it as a Docker image on Fly.io. The look and feel of my portfolio site are based on the Full Stack Open online web development course.
